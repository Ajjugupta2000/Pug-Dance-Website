# Pug-Dance-Website
Dance Website using pug(template Engine) and NodeJs together.
Pug is a template engine for Node and for the browser. It compiles to HTML and has a simplified syntax, which can make you more productive and your code more readable. Pug makes it easy both to write reusable HTML, as well as to render data pulled from a database or API.
